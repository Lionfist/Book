    Solomon Grundy, born on a Monday,
    Christened on a stark and stormy Tuesday,
    Married on a gray and grisly Wednesday,
    Took ill on a mild and mellow Thursday,
    Grew worse on a bright and breezy Friday,
    Died on a gray and glorious Saturday,
    Buried on a baking, blistering Sunday.
    That was the end of Solomon Grundy.
